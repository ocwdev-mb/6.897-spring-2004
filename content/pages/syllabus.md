Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

We assume that you have taken 6.875 Introduction to Cryptography, or have equivalent introduction to theoretical cryptography (see the instructors if you have questions about your background).

Course Materials
----------------

There is no text for this course. We will make all materials for this course available on-line.

Grading Policy
--------------

There will most likely be (approximately) four homework assignments. There will be no quizzes or finals. Students will "scribe" lectures in rotation. (Scribe notes must be written up in latex, and be reasonably "polished.")

The final grade will be computed using the following weights:

{{< tableopen >}}
{{< theadopen >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< thopen >}}

Homeworks
---------

We require that all homework solutions be typed up in latex. Hand-drawn diagrams are permitted.

Collaboration Policy
--------------------

We strongly encourage collaboration. We do not expect you to be able to solve every homework problem on your own. We **do**, however, expect you to write up your own solution to every problem even if the solution is the result of a collaborative effort. To repeat: each person **must** write up their solutions separately. Also, in your write-up please credit the people with whom you worked. Also, please note on your homework which sources you used for each problem.
